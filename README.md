### NOTE: The below accounts are ones that I have my code geared towards and have hosted on my virtual private server. I have not deployed Reddit code to my server. I have no use to deploy it because no community requested a Reddit bot. However, I will continue to create and fix bots for various social media platforms even if I do not use them.

####  Example of Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/postsalestoredditest
####  Example Screenshots of Discord: https://ibb.co/XXgdFNR

#### Instagram Account:

#### Twitter Accounts:

#### Discord Bot (for the server):

#### Hello. This is an open-source project I created for anyone to use to post OpenSea sales for their NFT collection on Twitter and/or Instagram! Currently, I have the bots running for a few NFT Collections. Before I start explaining everything, I would like to note that the Instagram account is least preferable. There are many things that are challenging with the Instagram version. Most of these things reside in getting the API developer account itself, creating a Facebook page just to link the Instagram and post on it (it's required in their weird Graph API), trying to figure out how to use their API, etc. Well, their API isn't that hard to use but the Content Publishing feature (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/content-publishing/) is quite new.
